FYI the main developer of this bot is ashamed of the code years later.

## Setup & Installation

To test locally, run `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token ./run_no_aws`

Image command work cannot be tested without an AWS environment set up in a super specific way. Sorry.

In order to use YouTube services, pass a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable. If you don't have one, it's probably not worth getting one. Just let the bot die.
