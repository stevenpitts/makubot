I'm Makubot! I have ***hundreds*** of community-driven image commands, \
and you can add more!
If you can think of an emotion, or a character, or a TV show, I probably have \
a command for it. Try `mb.angry`, `mb.nao`, or `mb.f`!
If I don't have that command, you can add an image to it by using \
`mb.addimage`! Then my owner will approve the image, and it'll \
get added to my collection!
I'm not just another image bot; I can process lots of image/video types, \
I'll try to show you only images relevant to you, and I'm \
super speedy! Check me out!
{help_commands_text}
{minor_help_commands_text} \
For detailed help on a command and how to use it, use `mb.help CommandName`!
